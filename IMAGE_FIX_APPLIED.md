# Image Loading Fixes Applied

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Next.js Configuration (`next.config.ts`)
- Updated image domains configuration with `remotePatterns` for better Cloudinary support
- Added experimental features for better timeout handling
- Maintained backward compatibility with legacy `domains` config

### 2. Enhanced Image Utilities (`lib/imageUtils.ts`)
- Added `optimizeCloudinaryUrl()` function for direct Cloudinary optimization
- Enhanced `handleImageError()` with multiple fallback strategies:
  1. Try custom image proxy for timeout issues
  2. Try direct Cloudinary optimization
  3. Final fallback to placeholder
- Added `createImageProps()` helper for consistent image component props

### 3. Created Image Proxy API (`app/api/image-proxy/route.ts`)
- Custom API route to handle Cloudinary images that timeout with Next.js optimization
- Bypasses Next.js Image optimization for problematic URLs
- Includes proper error handling and timeouts

### 4. Updated Image Components
- **ProductImageGallery**: Enhanced with retry mechanism and fallback handling
- **ProductInformation**: Updated to use new image utilities
- **OptimizedImage**: Enhanced with multiple retry strategies and proxy support

## How It Fixes the 504 Gateway Timeout Issue

1. **Primary Fix**: When Next.js Image optimization times out on Cloudinary URLs, the error handler automatically tries our custom image proxy
2. **Secondary Fix**: If the proxy fails, it tries direct Cloudinary URLs with optimizations
3. **Tertiary Fix**: Final fallback to placeholder image prevents broken image displays

## To Apply Changes

1. **Restart the development server**:
   ```bash
   # Stop current server (Ctrl+C)
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```

2. **Clear Next.js cache** (if issues persist):
   ```bash
   rm -rf .next
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Monitor browser console** for image loading logs to verify fixes are working

## Expected Behavior After Fix

- Images should load faster with proper fallbacks
- 504 Gateway Timeout errors should be automatically handled
- Console will show retry attempts and fallback strategies
- Placeholder images appear for truly failed loads instead of broken image icons

## Testing

1. Open a product page with Cloudinary images
2. Check browser Network tab for image requests
3. Verify no 504 errors persist
4. Check console for image loading logs
